<br>
<br>under the glistening of a billion suns
<br>floating upon the open ocean
<br>my arms disturb my bed of saltwater
<br>and while i worry no more
<br>my vessel long dashed against countless waves
<br>i begin to count
<br>how many of them yet exist
<br>so under the glistening of ancient lights
<br>floating over countless creatures
<br>my arms disturb my bed of saltwater
<br>and i worry no more
<br>
<br>I don't know anyone as crazy as you someone says from the back seat.
 I'm weaving my way across the asphalt of a winding road with an ocean 
on one side, and a pine forest on the other side. The car sways left and
 right with each turn. Cigarette smoke floats up towards eighty mile an 
hour wind shearing across open windows. There's the hint of marijuana, 
and a few roaches in some of the ashtrays. I say nothing in return; I do
 a quick smirk of pride and realize I need to concentrate or die in the 
ocean a hundred feet below, or crash up against some sturdy tree.
<br>
<br>The next thing I remember I'm at home with my mini-disc player 
blasting tiny holes into my eardrums. Judy says I need to turn that shit
 down. She's sitting at a desk across the room, glancing down at me 
sitting cross-legged at the center of a large rug we put there to cover 
up a one foot wide burnt hole in the apartment's carpet. I manipulate 
the controls of my player until she returns to her studies. Philosophy 
is a lost art she says. Everyone does and thinks what they're told. 
Nobody thinks anything new any more. It's all just regurgitated 
propaganda she says. I can always just marry with someone with money she
 says. She jokes but she does worry about retirement. Twenty three years
 old and she worries about retirement. I say I don't care about 
philosophies let's get stoned. We sit together on the futon passing a 
cloudy bong back and forth and watch shitty infomercials until I wake up
 hours later; sprawled out on the floor with a chewed up pen half-way 
clutched in my left hand. I'm woke up by gunshots outside. Loser I had 
written into my palm. The smeared words shocked and confused me for a 
while. I sat staring at them until I mustered the courage to wash them 
clean. Sirens blaze their way through traffic outside. The stale smell 
of exhaust and refinery gases permeate my every breath. Judy must be 
out. I hear nothing except for a steady rhythm of a leaky faucet 
dripping into a used coffee cup in one of the sinks. I find myself 
wandering dark night alleys and streets. I wonder where the homeless are
 sleeping. Or the birds. Where do the birds go to sleep away the night? 
The air is a whip of icy moisture; as usual. Distant mountains are 
peaked with snow. A lifted diesel truck swerves between the two opposite
 lanes. I watch them from behind as they speed off into the distance. 
Must be going at least thirty-five miles an hour I think. I have no idea
 why thirty-five popped into my mind. They seemed to be going much 
faster; but the number just screamed inside my head.
<br>
<br>I remember one late evening at work. I can hear a commercial on the 
radio. Pulse is normal it says. Diastolic is elevated. I don't know 
anyone as crazy as you. I glance behind me from my perch behind a cash 
register at the local convenience store. I'm stuffing twenties into my 
pocket. I can swear I've heard that somewhere. I don't know anyone as 
crazy as... A large man drops a bag of chips next to a bottle of milk 
already sitting on the counter. I'll have a carton of short reds he 
says. I bring the carton to the counter before him. And a carton of 
lights as well he says; and as I return to the counter with more 
cigarettes, he and his reds are nowhere to be found. A bottle of milk 
rolls across the counter and smashes into the ground while the front 
door shuts with a mocking ding. You're a loser it says; but really it 
can't talk. Can't be real I think. Must be the drugs, or the lack of 
sleep from the drugs. I'm losing my mind from the lack of sleep from 
drugs.
<br>
<br>One day I was sitting in a garden chair peering through a telescope 
pointed at the moon. I remember the constant adjusting to compensate for
 the drifting moon. I wanted to be an astronaut. The thought of visiting
 outer space thrilled me with excitement; but gravity kept me firmly 
fixed upon the surface here on Earth. The idea of being trapped 
infuriated and immiserated me. I took the telescope and smashed it into 
the ground; but that wasn't good enough. I swung the elongated 
instrument into the pavement over and over until bits of aluminum dug 
deep into the skin of my palms. I wanted to set off all those nuclear 
bombs that put us in debt. I wanted to stuff the faces of Big Oil 
executives with sulfur. I wanted to set fire to cigarette advertisers. I
 wanted to send us all to the dark ages.
<br>
<br>The earth is in orbit I was taught. Orbit means the satellite is 
falling into the thing its orbiting, it just takes a little longer for 
the two to collide than you would think because of angular momentum. The
 sun will someday become supernova and fry Earth's crust and kill every 
single living thing on board. We can only detect meteorites next to the 
sun they say. All the other meteorites are never detected they say. Like
 the dinosaurs, we are doomed to live in fear of the total extinction of
 every known living organism.
<br>
<br>Nothing natural is ever going to change human nature. They say 
things humans make aren't natural. If an ant colony builds a bunch of 
holes and tunnels into the ground; or if a beaver builds a dam against a
 river, it's a natural phenomena. When they say a microwave oven isn't 
natural, they're saying humans aren't part of nature. We're either 
supernatural or sub-natural. I'd say our self-destructive suicidal 
nature makes us sub-natural. We regularly invent new ways to kill over 
petty quarrels. We commit genocide. We conceitedly think we are somehow 
separate from nature so we can rationalize being not responsible for our
 crimes against it.
<br>
<br>They never really tell children these things. Children think they 
will live forever. Omission is the same as lying. Tell them ask your 
parents to call this number and buy this thing. Want a pony or a monster
 truck they say. You can't die. Want more. Don't think for yourself. 
Turn up your television they say. Work hard. Buy things made with slave 
labor in a place you'll never see. Pay into the system that makes you a 
slave of survival. Or don't work. And don't eat anything or drink 
anything. Don't buy clothes. Run around naked and dying and get 
arrested. Breathe toxic air. Drive a car and use electricity. I'm 
digressing. As for my childhood I hardly remember a thing. A glimpse 
here and there. Mostly nothing.
<br>
<br>I don't know anyone as crazy as you. I turn around at the speaker of
 the statement. My feet slip against the cliff side as I do so. I begin 
to plummet towards nothingness. I don't know anyone as crazy as you. And
 then I died. That's how this ends. I die inside. The scene cuts to 
black. Credits roll. The end.
<br>
<br>We're all already dead inside. We're all living a lie of prosperity.
 Nobody cares. Over ninety-nine percent of the world will never even 
meet me. If I tried to meet every living person on earth; one for each 
and every second, I would only be able to meet everyone after two 
hundred twenty nine years. It would take two hundred twenty nine years 
to meet seven billion people. One for each second.
<br>
<br>That makes me think of Einstein's equation; e = mcc . I'm told it's 
not really the whole equation; just a simplified version of a complex 
series of equations. Either way it's profound. e is energy in joules, m 
is mass in kilograms, and c is the speed of light measured in meters per
 second; which is just under three hundred million. If we take a the 
approximate weight of a resting Volkswagen Beetle, multiply that by the 
speed of light squared, we have seventy-three point seven quintillion 
joules. The basal metabolic rate of a human is about forty-six point 
seven billion joules per day. An average person would need to live for 
over four million years in order to equate their lifetime metabolism to 
the energy of a resting Volkswagen beetle; over a million years longer 
than the genus hominid has existed.
<br>
<br>I step outside into the twilight. A group of birds chirp a frantic 
song as they evacuate a nearby tree. The long shadows cast by their 
flight against the falling sun looks like moving notes on a sheet of 
music. Several police cars are chaotically parked against the sidewalk 
down the street. As the sun collapses behind the horizon, their lights 
cast a pulsating show of reds, whites, and blues against a dark figure 
being covered up under a brightly colored yellow tarp. Several officers 
closer to me frantically scurry to and fro; occasionally turning their 
heads to speak into radios clipped to their collars. Three-eleven. 
Suspect is on foot. Suspect is armed. I slowly creep backwards through 
the front door and into our apartment.
<br>
<br>Before long I'm walking home down the median of a deserted street. A
 sole car in the distance breaks a cold silence; and as it screams past 
me at impossible speeds the driver throws a paper cup full of water at 
me. It lands several feet away and splashes in long lines across the 
median. I continue home; stepping over busted ice cubes and fizzing soda
 water. It's piss and spit he says. I don't know anyone as crazy as you.
 Then nothing. How high am I? I'm sober I think. Nobody said any of 
those things. He doesn't even know me. Minutes later I'm crawling into 
dirty sheets on an old cigarette smoke laiden bed; and the next thing I 
know I'm peeking out at the falling sun creeping through my shades. 
Something familiar makes me want to peek outside. I hear a gunshot but I
 at the same time I don't. My vision darts towards the television 
playing an old Western. Glamorized violence I think as a character falls
 into a padded mat cleverly hidden beneath some dirt. Saloon it says 
above him from a shot of the killer looking down at his last bleeding 
moments.
<br>
<br>The clock on the wall strikes eleven. A bell sounds nine times until
 my ears ring. Then it tolls two more times. I don't know where I'm 
going with telling this to you, Judy. I don't know anything at all about
 what is happening to me. Judy, what is wrong with me I scream; and fall
 back into the wall. Bam. Now I'm bleeding through my hair. It's black 
so all I see in the mirror is a matted mess. My fingertips are red. The 
wall has an oval dent in it. I'm done with this I say. I'm going to 
sleep.
<br>
<br>I dream I am at home; sitting in my father's den with a glass of 
scotch in his hand. Can you hear me he says. I glance up from the ornate
 rug beneath the the two chairs. Of course I can hear you. What a silly 
question I say. If you can hear me, squeeze my hand. That's not very 
funny, Dad. I give a sour look, I think... My thoughts trail off for a 
second as I pause mid-sentence. I can almost remember something. 
Something very important. Like a starving homeless person watching a 
food channel, I can't make the thought tangible.
<br>
<br>An eon ago dinosaurs roamed the earth. We can still find remnants of
 them in crocodiles and snakes; although modern reptiles pale in 
comparison to the ferocious killing aptitude of their predecessors. The 
curious thing is dinosaurs are known not for their existence, but rather
 their lack of existence. Like a shadow giving contrast to light, 
dinosaurs instill excited curiosity in both children and adults not 
because they did exist; but rather because they no longer exist. And 
just like many other pivotal moments in the history of our planet's 
life, we are once again being reminded of our collective mortality. The 
issue isn't if or if not humans are the cause of global warming; nor is 
the issue whether or not you, anyone else, or I believe it. The issue 
resides inside the idea that a threat to the existence of all life on 
this planet is not something any sane thinking person can ignore. If 
someone straps a remotely-controlled bomb to my chest, I doubt I'm going
 to ever think hey this might be a clock radio stuffed in some play 
dough, I wonder if I can get any good stations on this. In rational 
thought, I'm going to be not only very interested in preserving my 
existence; moreover I'm going to be extraordinarily interested in 
discovering how to disarm explosive devices. Saying global warming is 
this, that, or whatever is irrelevant. What matters is cohesively 
deducing if it is not true; and of course what to do about it if it is 
true.
<br>
<br>I read somewhere an idea that struck me as fascinating. According to
 some Quantum Mechanics, the entire universe we know today 
instantaneously created itself into a state leading to the moment I am 
experiencing now. After a while I decided that hypothesis, true or not, 
is completely inane. The probability of rolling a one with a six-sided 
dice is 1 / 6 . The probability of anything happening over the span of 
infinite time is a little more tricky. Let's say we have a probability 
n; and the span &#8734;. That gives us n / &#8734; . Which means n divided into 
infinite parts; another way of saying infinitesimal. The probability of 
reality spontaneously existing is infinitesimal. I know if that theory 
is correct, then it has already happened because I experience the 
universe.
<br>
<br>I'm jolted awake by a nauseating headache. My blood laiden pillow 
makes a wet sound as I turn over to peek at my alarm clock. I had slept 
for just over two hours. Oh my God Judy says. You need to see a doctor 
now she says. You need help. Didn't you even know you were bleeding? I 
feel dizzy and fall to the floor like a bag of bricks. The last thing I 
remember of that day is the first part of half of a phone conversation. I
 have an emergency. I need an ambulance. My friend is bleeding to death.
 My address? It's?
<br>
<br>I wake up in the hospital the next day. At least I think it was the 
next day. I didn't stay long. Shit I say. I can't pay for this. I 
forcefully remove myself from four fuzzy restraints. A slow trickle of 
blood begins to drip from where a plastic needle had been. By the time I
 find myself at home the left side of my shirt is covered in blood. I 
crawl back into bed and dream the dreams of a thousand nights. When I 
wake up many hours later, two police officers are at the door. You need 
to come with us they say. I don't want to I say. They take me under each
 arm and drag me to their car. Outside their car I begin to panic. I 
squirm under their forceful control. The one to my left takes my arm and
 swings it behind my back. I'll break it he says; so I calm down. I sit 
in the back of the squad car for a few minutes until the officers say 
you can go. Judy and I wait for the assholes to leave. We need to get 
high she says. This is too much. Foobar I say. Do you know what that 
means? No she says. I finish packing the bowl. Never mind. It's not 
important. Lets forget today.
<br>
<br>I don't know anyone as... Judy nearly falls over laughing. The last 
three words a garbled mess of laughter. I realize my lips are puckered 
like a fish; I was trying to explain how fish have no feelings. Nirvana 
said so. And so he interviewed a fish to discover this revelation? No I 
say. Fish don't have language. At least one we can understand. She 
challenges me to be a speaking fish; and I accept. We spend the rest of 
the night playing video games and eating old pizza. Finally at the end 
of the night, sitting on the bed with her amongst strewn and stale 
popcorn, video controllers, and spilled bong water, I realized these are
 quite possibly the happiest times of my life. Face down as the sun 
rises; Judy is lying on her back to my left. Good night she says. I fall
 asleep to the rhythm of her heartbeat.
<br>
<br>I wake up in one of those reclining hospital beds; except I am in a 
house of sorts. A beeping machine chirps to life beside the bed. As I 
open my eyes I see a rotating fan covered in black dust. A nurse in 
uniform runs into the room; and in shock immediately drops a clipboard 
holding some loose papers onto the floor. You were in an accident she 
says. You drove off a cliff. Who's Judy she says. You need to rest she 
says. You've been asleep for years she says. I clench my eyes shut. 
Tears stream down my face as I scream at the ceiling. I spend the next 
few days in that bed. Various people come and go.
<br>
<br>In the evening a few days later I begin to drift off. I dream I am 
driving down a winding road bordered by a sheer cliff side to the left, 
and a sprawling pine forest on the other side. I snuff out a lit joint 
into the console ashtray. Passing cars in the other lane scream past at 
impossible speeds. I hear a voice coming from the back seat. I don't 
know anyone crazier than you.
